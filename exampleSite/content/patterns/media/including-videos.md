title: Including videos
---

**Cupper** has a lot of its own shortcodes, but you can still use Hugo's [built in shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/extras/shortcodes#built-in-shortcodes). These include a simple shortcode for including YouTube videos in your content. The shortcode takes just one parameter â€” the video's `id`.

```go-html-template
{{</* youtube w7Ft2ymGmfc */>}}
```
